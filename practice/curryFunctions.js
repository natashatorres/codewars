/*

To complete this Kata you need to make a function multiplyAll/multiply_all which takes an array of integers 
as an argument. This function must return another function, which takes a single integer as an argument and 
returns a new array. The returned array should consist of each of the elements from the first array multiplied 
by the integer.

*/

function multiplyAll(arr){
    arr.map(e => e * 2 )
}
